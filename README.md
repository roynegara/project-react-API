# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


In development process, I used:
1. Node js version 18.17.1
2. NPM version 9.6.7
3. Vite version 5.1.5
   
For dependencies, I used:
1. axios: version 1.6.7
2. react: version 18.2.0
3. react-dom: version 18.2.0
4. react-router-dom: version 6.22.2

How to run thos project?
The First is open with code "NPM run dev"

This is will apear
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

  
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.


Then if you want to stop server localhost just press Ctrl + C, and then just press Y if you want to shutdown the server.

Thank you
